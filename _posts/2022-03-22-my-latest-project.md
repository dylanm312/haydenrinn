# Intro

Hey everyone, it's HayHay42069 checking in. Hope everyone is doing well. As I approach my last quarter of college, I wanted to share some exciting new with you about a new project I'm taking on. Hope you enjoy!

# The News

I'm smart. Like really *really* smart. But you already know that. College is just too easy for me sometimes. I get so bored in my 400-level computer science classes that I end up filling my time with side projects (like this one) to keep myself entertained.

You know what Linus Torvalds, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates have in common? They all have #grit. And #determination. As The Rock so aptly puts it, "It's about drive; it's about power - we stay hungry; we devour." They decided to tackle more than they ever thought they could possible handle. Just as an out-of-practice skier tackling the steepest, most advanced terrain, might tumble down the mountain, or lose a ski, or nearly crash into a tree, these fine gentlemen, too, had their setbacks. They stayed up all night debugging, after their fourth Yerb of the day; they accidentally `git branch -d -F` when they meant to `git stash && git checkout`; and they most certainly generated `init: fatal signal: Segmentation fault`'s galore. But, through it all, they persisted. And now, decades of hard work later, we take for granted the fruits of their labor in the form of Linux, macOS, and some crappy off-brand garbage that stole its default browser architecture from Google.

So, I decided to rise above the plebians at Cal Poly Humboldt. I decided that it was time for me to take on a challenge of such magnitude as to join the elite ranks of Mr. Torvalds and Mr. Jobs. I enrolled in CSC 454: Implementing Operating Systems. Because I can. And because it will be the birthplace of my latest and greatest project: **rinnOS**(c)(tm)(r).
